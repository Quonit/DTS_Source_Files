			//Oh... Well, I suppose I should... (sigh) I'm so sorry! I'm normally not so anxious to be talking to others. It's just been busy as of late. I promise I'm fine though.
			//Who you're looking for
			//Well, it's my brother you see... I was just looking for him because we had something scedualed, and somehow I somehow ended up hear.
		//Scedualed?
			//Well it's me and my brother's birthday- we're twins, so we share the same one. I wasn't able to find him, and usually when that happens it means he's out in the forest- or... that is how I think it used to be. Some days I looked through and... Oh, sorry, I'm talking too much, aren't I?
		//Brother

			//* (You hand them a boquet of flowers.) Oh, these are nice. I could probably get my brother to tell them apart... I'm not very good at remembering the names. But I like them!
			//* (
		//Plush
